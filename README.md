## Problem Statement: Intelligent Drug Discovery Insights Extraction

#### Overview:
The goal is to develop a system that utilizes ML/DL models to extract relevant insights from the provided data related to drug candidates. The system will take input in the form of drug candidate information data and output key insights such as:-
1. Drug potency (pIC50 value)
2. Model explainability:- Which of the drug properties (features) had the most impact on the prediction.

#### Input:
1. **Drug Candidate Information:** A csv file containing details about a drug candidate.

    This dataset consists of 2 different files for a potential drug against the COVID-19 virus. The original file consists of only a SMILES notation and pIC50 constant against the COVID-19 virus for a chemical compound. The second one consists of engineered features using the pubchempy library of Python. This library helps to access the PubChem data. PubChem is a database of millions of chemical compounds. We used this library to fetch the properties of the compounds using their SMILES representation.
    
    The dataset is made publically available by the Government of India as a part of their Drug Discovery Hackathon. There are some potential drugs against the COVID-19 virus in this dataset as suggested by the hackathon organisers.
    
    ##### Column information:-
    - CID: Compound ID
    - SMILES: SMILES notation of the compound
    - MolecularFormula: Molecular Formula of the compound
    - MolecularWeight: Molecular weight of the compound
    - InChI: InChI representation of the compound
    - InChIKey: InChI ID
    - UPACName: IUPAC Name of the compound
    The rest of the columns are chemical features extracted using the `pubchempy` library.

#### Expected Output:
The output will be a structured prediction csv file containing extracted insights, such as:
- plc50 values
- Feature importance values

#### Input Examples:

1. **CSV data input:**

|CID    |SMILES                                                             |MolecularFormula|
